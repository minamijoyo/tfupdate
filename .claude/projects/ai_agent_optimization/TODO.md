  - [ ] Test basic operations for each command
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Consolidate and standardize test helper functions

### 2. Architecture Documentation Creation
- [ ] Create system design diagrams
  - [ ] Package dependency relationship diagram
  - [ ] Data flow diagrams
- [ ] Add interface specification documentation
  - [ ] Detailed specs for main interfaces (Updater, Release, etc.)
  - [ ] Formalize API contracts
- [ ] Record design decisions (ADR: Architecture Decision Records)
  - [ ] Why interface-driven design was adopted
  - [ ] Rationale for factory pattern adoption

### 3. Code Readability Enhancement
- [ ] Split lengthy functions
  - [ ] Identify and split functions exceeding 100 lines
  - [ ] Apply single responsibility principle
- [ ] Rename functions/variables to express intent
  - [ ] Eliminate abbreviations

## Guidelines

- Progress each item incrementally
- Always write tests first (TDD)
- Minimize impact on existing functionality
- Update documentation simultaneously with implementation
- Always consider AI agent work efficiency
- **ALL documentation and comments must be written in English**
