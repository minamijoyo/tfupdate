The security policy for this project is as follows.

## General
This project is open source and is provided "as is."

We will do our best to address security issues, but the project maintainers make no guarantees regarding whether or when they will be addressed. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

## Supported versions
This project only supports the latest version. We do not provide security patches for previous versions.

## Policy for fixing known vulnerabilities in dependency libraries
This project uses the "Dependabot alerts" and "Dependabot security updates" features to manage known vulnerabilities in dependency libraries. We will address vulnerabilities in dependency libraries as appropriate, so there is no need to report them as new vulnerabilities in this project. If Dependabot is not working properly for some reason, feel free to create a pull request. For the issue that has already been made public, we don't need to discuss it privately.

We do not provide patch releases for every issue we fix, except for critical ones. Instead, we release multiple fixes together as a patch. The severity is determined based on whether it is critical for this project, not the score reported for the dependency library.

## How to report a security issue privately
If you discover a security issue in this project, please refrain from reporting it using a public issue. Instead, please use GitHub's "Private vulnerability reporting" feature to report it.
